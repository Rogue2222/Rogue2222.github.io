    understand each other perfectly
    a big bonding tool for these personality
    types in a relationship
    is that they tend to understand each
    other perfectly
    they are both intuitive and have the
    ability to hear the unsaid words
    whenever they're together
    in a relationship they are both
    comfortable to discuss
    weird and awkward things which they will
    ordinarily not talk about with other
    people
    they do not have to speak to know how
    their partner is feeling
    they have a high level of connection
    that is almost telepathic
    which helps them to be in constant
    contact with each other
